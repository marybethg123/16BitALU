# 16 Bit Arithhmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

## Description

This project is the culmination of my work in my Digital System Design course. This ALU consists of a 16-bit adder, subtractor, incrementer, and shifter as well as an 8-bit multiplier.

## Environment

* **Xilinx Vivado 2019.2**

## How to Build the Original Project

* Open Vivado 2019.2 Tcl Shell
* Navigate to project files
* `source build.tcl`
* A new ALU16B folder should appear and you are now set up with the original project
